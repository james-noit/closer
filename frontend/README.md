# Frontend

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.2.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Configuration and environments

The application uses Angular's `src/environments` files to store configuration values such as the base
URL of the backend API. The two main files are:

* `environment.ts` – development (default, points to `http://localhost:8080/api`).
* `environment.prod.ts` – production; automatically substituted during a `ng build --configuration production`.

The production configuration is defined via a file replacement entry in `angular.json`,
so building for prod will bundle the appropriate `apiUrl` value.  

Services (e.g. `AuthService`) import this object and build requests with `environment.apiUrl`.

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
